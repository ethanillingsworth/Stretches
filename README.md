# Stretches

## Our Goal
To make a simple yet fully featured task managment app that streches out your larger goals into smaller ones.

## Setup
Since Stretches isnt available on the app store yet, we recommend using [Swift Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) to run the project.

### Playgrounds
1. Install [Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) for Mac or iPad
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/ethanillingsworth/Stretches/releases/latest/download/Stretches.zip) of Stretches
3. Unzip the zip file you got from the latest release and open the folder, you should see Stretches.swiftpm
4. Move Stretches.swiftpm to your Playgrounds folder or tap/click to open it in playgrounds.
5. Enjoy!
